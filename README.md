## problem

students often lose track of time due to distractions like web surfing, doom scrolling, and wavering attention spans. studysmart tries to tackle these problems by using a 5 minute just start studying timer and a detailed summary of tabs opened while studying.

## features

- clean, distraction-free landing page
- "start studying" and "lock in time" focus modes
- stopwatch mode for open-ended focus
- timer mode with manual time input
- minimal, calm UI designed for low cognitive load
- fully client-side (no login required)
